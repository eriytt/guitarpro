# Guitar tools

## Introduction

In the beginning, this was just a library to read gGuitar Pro files, but I had lot of ideas so I split this sproject:

- the [library](lib/README.md) to read **Guitar Pro** files (GP3, GP4, GP5, GPX, GP) and **MuseScore** files (MSCZ)
- the [CLI tool](cli/README.md) to perform batch operations
- a [web server](web_server/README.md) to search music scores and tabs using a database through a future documented API
