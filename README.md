# Guitar tools

## Introduction

In the beginning, this was just a library to read gGuitar Pro files, but I had lot of ideas so I split this sproject:

- the [library](lib/README.md) to read **Guitar Pro** files (GP3, GP4, GP5, GPX, GP) and **MuseScore** files (MSCZ)
- the [CLI tool](cli/README.md) to perform batch operations
- a [web server](web_server/README.md) to search music scores and tabs using a database through a future documented API

## About me

I started to play guitar in 2019 and I have a pack of Guitar Pro files and sometimes I get a new files from [Songsterr](https://www.songsterr.com/). I want to write a better documentation but I don't know all the stuffs that I can see on a score ;)

In order to make another software (with advanced search, chord detection, ...), I need a library that is able to parse and write Guitar Pro files.
